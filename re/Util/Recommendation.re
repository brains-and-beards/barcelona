Somewhere above the countless rock pillars and needles sits a monastery with a beautiful church.\n\nYou can get there by car (if you're early enough to still find a spot on the parking lot), or a cable car. from the town down below. Alternatively, you can take a wonderful, long via ferrata (an equiped climbing route) that goes straight up the rock walls and ends climbing over the fence ont a panoramic view platform on one of the highest points on the mountain. Only recommended if you've done via ferratas before and you know what you're getting yourself into!|js},

The city is quite walkable, but getting a bicycle is taking the whole experience to a different level. \n\n You don't need to follow any organised tours, just pick a direction and go. From the top of Park G√ºell down to Barceloneta there's plenty of places to see. One of many nice rides is going from Gr√†cia district down Passeig de Sant Joan, passing the Arc de Triomf and following still the same straight line to Parc de la Ciutadella. There you can lie down on the grass and take a break, or pedal a bit more to the beach.\n\nEnjoy!|js},

Local community each year runs a competition for the best decorated street. The theme can be anything, I've seen zombies, classical music, underwater world, pirates, and basically anything in-between.\n\nIf you're in Barcelona in August, make sure to check the dates and enjoy the longest party in town!|js},
